# Create My React App

`create-my-react-app` is a lightweight CLI tool for generating React project templates effortlessly. It scaffolds a ready-to-use React application with a simple folder structure, essential files, and pre-installed dependencies.

## Features

- Generates a React project with a basic folder structure:
  - `public/`: Contains `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
  - `src/`: Includes `App.js`, `index.js`, and `App.css`.
- Automatically installs the necessary dependencies (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`).
- Simple and fast, perfect for quickly starting new projects.
